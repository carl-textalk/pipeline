<i>Don't merge this PR directly! It may be reviewed, tested, discussed and finalized here. But when it is ready to be merged, split it up into one PR for each sub-repo, and then pull from the sub-repos as soon as all the sub-PRs have been merged to the master branch. Changes to third party projects need to be released before the dependent PRs can be merged.</i>
